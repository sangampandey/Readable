 * Out of the box, the Redux store can only support the synchronous flow of data.
 * Using middleware like thunk helps support asynchronicity in a Redux application.
 * You can think of thunk as a wrapper for the storeâ€™s dispatch() method; rather than returning action objects,
 * we can use thunk action creators to dispatch functions or Promises.
 * Note that without thunks, synchronous dispatches are the default.
